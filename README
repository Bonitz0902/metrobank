Running the Application
To run the application, simply execute DemoApplication.java.

Please note:

* I have not yet implemented the JWT token authentication as it is a new concept for me and I faced challenges in doing so within the given timeframe.
* My focus has been on ensuring the application is easy to understand and use.






Run Gradle -> Run application
Java Version: jbr-17 17.0.8






To test the APIs:
POST
http://localhost:8080/parkingLot/create
{
    "parkingLotId": "PL001",
    "location": "Downtown",
    "numberOfSlot": 10,
    "costPerMinute": 0.25
}

POST
http://localhost:8080/parkingLot/parkVehicle?location=Downtown
{
    "licensePlate": "ABC12342",
    "type": "Car",
    "ownerName": "John Doe"
}

after that, you can check other controllers for the other features that you mention.


Thank you, I hope this meets your expectations.
